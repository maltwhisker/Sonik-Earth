# Sonik Earth Beta
Generative Soundscape via Google Earth Exploration

Installation:

Runs on Mac OS X only. Tested on Yosemite, however may work with some previous versions.

This app has been compiled with the version of Pure Data that it runs on (Pd Extended 0.43.4), so in theory you shouldn’t need to download anything else to use it. Just drag it into your applications folder.

Instructions:

	1.	Open Sonik Earth
	2.	Click on the VISUALS subpatch
	3.	You can use either Live Input or Load Video for visuals. Choose which one you want to use by enabling edit mode (⌘E), and connecting the outlet of the [gemhead] object to either the inlet of [pix_movie] or [pix_video].
	4.	If using Load Video, click the open video file button to select a compatible video file from your computer. If using Live Input, connect any camera recognised by your operating system, if not it will default to the FaceTime Webcam. 
	5.	In the main app window, click the red button to open the visuals window (GEM). If your Load Video file is displayed wrong, reopen the VISUALS subpatch and toggle the ‘fit to window’ option. To play your file click the ‘play/pause’ toggle in the subpatch.  
	6.	Turn on the DSP if it isn’t already.
	7.	Click on the SYNTHESIS subpatch and click on the ‘synth setup’ button.
	8.	In the main window increase the volume to a desired level and use the controls on the left to turn on and off various parameters.
	9.	Enjoy!
